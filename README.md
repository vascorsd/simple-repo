# Description

Very basic template and example project for scala using latest cool `scala-cli` 
for quick iteration and build times. Useful for simple "scripts" or small apps
without the need of modules/submodules or any other complexity for bigger apps.

## Build / Development

### Requirements

  * jvm (optional) - either an installation with proper `JAVA_HOME` correctly set or the tool auto
    manages and downloads a jvm itself for usage
  * [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) (tested with version 0.1.15)
  * [just](https://github.com/casey/just)


Run `just` in the console at the root of this project and it will tell available commands.
Currently basicly wrapping the scala-cli commands which are already simple enough, but
this way you don't even need to care about that. Also useful to learn scala-cli tool itself.
